      "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in various tasks (e.g., long-context understanding), and many\nbenchmarks have been proposed. However, we observe that long text generation\ncapabilities are not well investigated. Therefore, we introduce the\nHierarchical Long Text Generation Benchmark (HelloBench), a comprehensive,\nin-the-wild, and open-ended benchmark to evaluate LLMs' performance in\ngenerating long text. Based on Bloom's Taxonomy, HelloBench categorizes long\ntext generation tasks into five subtasks: open-ended QA, summarization, chat,\ntext completion, and heuristic text generation. Besides, we propose\nHierarchical Long Text Evaluation (HelloEval), a human-aligned evaluation\nmethod that significantly reduces the time and effort required for human\nevaluation while maintaining a high correlation with human evaluation. We have\nconducted extensive experiments across around 30 mainstream LLMs and observed\nthat the current LLMs lack long text generation capabilities. Specifically,\nfirst, regardless of whether the instructions include explicit or implicit\nlength constraints, we observe that most LLMs cannot generate text that is\nlonger than 4000 words. Second, we observe that while some LLMs can generate\nlonger text, many issues exist (e.g., severe repetition and quality\ndegradation). Third, to demonstrate the effectiveness of HelloEval, we compare\nHelloEval with traditional metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, etc.) and LLM-as-a-Judge\nmethods, which show that HelloEval has the highest correlation with human\nevaluation. We release our code in https://github.com/Quehry/HelloBench.",

      "abstract": "Character video synthesis aims to produce realistic videos of animatable\ncharacters within lifelike scenes. As a fundamental problem in the computer\nvision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures\nfor per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling\narbitrary characters in a short time. Recent 2D methods break this limitation\nvia pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and\nscene interaction. To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can\nnot only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e.,\ncharacter, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also\nsimultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality\nto novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a\nunified framework. The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial\ncodes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely, we\nlift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and\ndecompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human,\nunderlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the\n3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code,\nstructured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control\nsignals of synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables\nflexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis\nfor scene interactions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed method.",

However, the capacity\nof these models to concurrently process and reason about multiple modalities\nremains inadequately explored, partly due to the lack of comprehensive\nmodality-wise benchmarks. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to\nrigorously evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across\nvisual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define models capable\nof such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench is\ndistinguished by high-quality human annotations, ensuring that accurate\nresponses require integrated understanding and reasoning across all three\nmodalities. Our main findings reveal that: i) open-source OLMs exhibit critical\nlimitations in instruction-following and reasoning capabilities within\ntri-modal contexts; and ii) the baseline models perform poorly (below 50%\naccuracy) even when provided with alternative textual representations of images\nand audio. These results suggest that the ability to construct a consistent\ncontext from text, image, and audio is often overlooked in existing MLLM\ntraining paradigms. We advocate for future research to focus on developing more\nrobust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM\nperformance across diverse modalities.

In this paper, we study face pareidolia from a computer vision\nperspective. We present an image dataset of ``Faces in Things'', consisting of\nfive thousand web images with human-annotated pareidolic faces.

We find that the evolutionary need for humans to detect animal faces,\nas well as human faces, may explain some of this gap. Finally, we propose a\nsimple statistical model of pareidolia in images. Through studies on human\nsubjects and our pareidolic face detectors we confirm a key prediction of our\nmodel regarding what image conditions are most likely to induce pareidolia.\nDataset and Website: https://aka.ms/faces-in-things",

In response, we\nintroduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train\nlarger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference\ncosts. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE\nenhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for\neach prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model\ncapacity.

We\npre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B,\nwhich spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points.

In this work, we present\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\nand nearest neighbors.

      "abstract": "Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models\n(LLMs) with human preferences. However, traditional RM training, which relies\non response pairs tied to specific prompts, struggles to disentangle\nprompt-driven preferences from prompt-independent artifacts, such as response\nlength and format. In this work, we expose a fundamental limitation of current\nRM training methods, where RMs fail to effectively distinguish between\ncontextual signals and irrelevant artifacts when determining preferences. To\naddress this, we introduce a causal framework that learns preferences\nindependent of these artifacts and propose a novel data augmentation technique\ndesigned to eliminate them. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nsuccessfully filters out undesirable artifacts, yielding a more robust reward\nmodel (RRM). Our RRM improves the performance of a pairwise reward model\ntrained on Gemma-2-9b-it, on RewardBench, increasing accuracy from 80.61% to\n84.15%. Additionally, we train two DPO policies using both the RM and RRM,\ndemonstrating that the RRM significantly enhances DPO-aligned policies,\nimproving MT-Bench scores from 7.27 to 8.31 and length-controlled win-rates in\nAlpacaEval-2 from 33.46% to 52.49%.",

      "abstract": "Generating synthetic tabular data is critical in machine learning, especially\nwhen real data is limited or sensitive. Traditional generative models often\nface challenges due to the unique characteristics of tabular data, such as\nmixed data types and varied distributions, and require complex preprocessing or\nlarge pretrained models. In this paper, we introduce a novel, lossless binary\ntransformation method that converts any tabular data into fixed-size binary\nrepresentations, and a corresponding new generative model called Binary\nDiffusion, specifically designed for binary data. Binary Diffusion leverages\nthe simplicity of XOR operations for noise addition and removal and employs\nbinary cross-entropy loss for training. Our approach eliminates the need for\nextensive preprocessing, complex noise parameter tuning, and pretraining on\nlarge datasets. We evaluate our model on several popular tabular benchmark\ndatasets, demonstrating that Binary Diffusion outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art models on Travel, Adult Income, and Diabetes datasets while\nbeing significantly smaller in size.",
