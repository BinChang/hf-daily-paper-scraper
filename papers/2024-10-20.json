We also show additional capabilities such as precise instruction-based\nvideo editing and generation of personalized videos based on a user's image.\nOur models set a new state-of-the-art on multiple tasks: text-to-video\nsynthesis, video personalization, video editing, video-to-audio generation, and\ntext-to-audio generation. Our largest video generation model is a 30B parameter\ntransformer trained with a maximum context length of 73K video tokens,\ncorresponding to a generated video of 16 seconds at 16 frames-per-second. We\nshow multiple technical innovations and simplifications on the architecture,\nlatent spaces, training objectives and recipes, data curation, evaluation\nprotocols, parallelization techniques, and inference optimizations that allow\nus to reap the benefits of scaling pre-training data, model size, and training\ncompute for training large scale media generation models.

However, the\nreliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs\nbecome more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring\nstronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a\njudge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more\nchallenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of\nfactual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation\nframework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we\npropose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging\nresponse pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench\nleverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into\nchallenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective\ncorrectness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges,\nfine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench\nposes a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many\nstrong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random\nguessing.

In this work, we investigate this scaling problem in the\ncontext of text-to-image generation, focusing on two critical factors: whether\nmodels use discrete or continuous tokens, and whether tokens are generated in a\nrandom or fixed raster order using BERT- or GPT-like transformer architectures.\nOur empirical results show that, while all models scale effectively in terms of\nvalidation loss, their evaluation performance -- measured by FID, GenEval\nscore, and visual quality -- follows different trends. Models based on\ncontinuous tokens achieve significantly better visual quality than those using\ndiscrete tokens. Furthermore, the generation order and attention mechanisms\nsignificantly affect the GenEval score: random-order models achieve notably\nbetter GenEval scores compared to raster-order models. Inspired by these\nfindings, we train Fluid, a random-order autoregressive model on continuous\ntokens.

To address this issue, we decouple\nvisual encoding into separate pathways, while still leveraging a single,\nunified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only\nalleviates the conflict between the visual encoder's roles in understanding and\ngeneration, but also enhances the framework's flexibility.

However,\nexisting methods often require complicated test-time fine-tuning and struggle\nwith balancing subject learning and motion control, limiting their real-world\napplications. In this paper, we present DreamVideo-2, a zero-shot video\ncustomization framework capable of generating videos with a specific subject\nand motion trajectory, guided by a single image and a bounding box sequence,\nrespectively, and without the need for test-time fine-tuning. Specifically, we\nintroduce reference attention, which leverages the model's inherent\ncapabilities for subject learning, and devise a mask-guided motion module to\nachieve precise motion control by fully utilizing the robust motion signal of\nbox masks derived from bounding boxes. While these two components achieve their\nintended functions, we empirically observe that motion control tends to\ndominate over subject learning. To address this, we propose two key designs: 1)\nthe masked reference attention, which integrates a blended latent mask modeling\nscheme into reference attention to enhance subject representations at the\ndesired positions, and 2) a reweighted diffusion loss, which differentiates the\ncontributions of regions inside and outside the bounding boxes to ensure a\nbalance between subject and motion control.

Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold\nequal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new\narchitecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each\ntoken to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency\nwithout compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second,\nMoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted\nsummation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking\nextra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs\ndemonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of\nthe attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head\nattention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH\nmodels. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14\nbenchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the\nattention heads.

To address\nthese issues, many LLM developers have implemented various safety measures to\nalign these models. This alignment involves several techniques, including data\nfiltering during pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback, and red-teaming exercises. These methods often introduce\ndeliberate and intentional biases similar to Political Correctness (PC) to\nensure the ethical behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we delve into the\nintentional biases injected into LLMs for safety purposes and examine methods\nto circumvent these safety alignment techniques. Notably, these intentional\nbiases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by\n20% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16% between white and\nblack keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We\nintroduce the concept of PCJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by\nthese safety-induced biases. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense\nmethod PCDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense\nprompts prior to generation. PCDefense stands as an appealing alternative to\nGuard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after\ntext generation. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for LLM developers to\nadopt a more responsible approach when designing and implementing safety\nmeasures.",

Stitching frames of a panning video\ninto a panoramic photograph is a well-understood problem for stationary scenes,\nbut when objects are moving, a still panorama cannot capture the scene. We\npresent a method for synthesizing a panoramic video from a casually-captured\npanning video, as if the original video were captured with a wide-angle camera.\nWe pose panorama synthesis as a space-time outpainting problem, where we aim to\ncreate a full panoramic video of the same length as the input video.

Existing\ngenerative models do not, however, immediately extend to panorama completion,\nas we show. We instead apply video generation as a component of our panorama\nsynthesis system, and demonstrate how to exploit the strengths of the models\nwhile minimizing their limitations.

      "abstract": "Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and\nacceleration of large language models~(LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it\nis crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error\nwith the equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various\npre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel\nscaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed\nweights and activations can still remain steep and outspread. In this paper, we\npropose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new\npost-training quantization approach to enhance flatness of weights and\nactivations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations tailored to\neach linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce\nruntime overhead, we apply Kronecker decomposition to the transformation\nmatrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive\nexperiments show that FlatQuant sets up a new state-of-the-art quantization\nbenchmark. For instance, it achieves less than 1% accuracy drop for\nW4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by\n7.5%. For inference latency, FlatQuant reduces the slowdown induced\nby pre-quantization transformation from 0.26x of QuaRot to merely\n0.07x, bringing up to 2.3x speedup for prefill and\n1.7x speedup for decoding, respectively.

Starting from a general MLLM, we\nturn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a\nkey-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar\nand other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP\nwill retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal\nretriever.

To further improve generation quality and alignment with\nuser-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create\na specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset,\nwe train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants.

Our\nkey insight is that if most tokens are redundant for the layer computation,\nthen can be skipped directly via the MoD layer. However, directly converting\nthe dense layers of MLLMs to MoD layers leads to substantial performance\ndegradation. To address this issue, we propose an innovative MoD adaptation\nstrategy for existing MLLMs called gamma-MoD. In gamma-MoD, a novel\nmetric is proposed to guide the deployment of MoDs in the MLLM, namely rank of\nattention maps (ARank). Through ARank, we can effectively identify which layer\nis redundant and should be replaced with the MoD layer. Based on ARank, we\nfurther propose two novel designs to maximize the computational sparsity of\nMLLM while maintaining its performance, namely shared vision-language router\nand masked routing learning. With these designs, more than 90% dense layers of\nthe MLLM can be effectively converted to the MoD ones. To validate our method,\nwe apply it to three popular MLLMs, and conduct extensive experiments on 9\nbenchmark datasets. Experimental results not only validate the significant\nefficiency benefit of gamma-MoD to existing MLLMs but also confirm its\ngeneralization ability on various MLLMs. For example, with a minor performance\ndrop, i.e., -1.5%, gamma-MoD can reduce the training and inference time of\nLLaVA-HR by 31.0% and 53.2%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Vision-language foundation models (such as CLIP) have recently shown their\npower in transfer learning, owing to large-scale image-text pre-training.\nHowever, target domain data in the downstream tasks can be highly different\nfrom the pre-training phase, which makes it hard for such a single model to\ngeneralize well. Alternatively, there exists a wide range of expert models that\ncontain diversified vision and/or language knowledge pre-trained on different\nmodalities, tasks, networks, and datasets. Unfortunately, these models are\n\"isolated agents\" with heterogeneous structures, and how to integrate their\nknowledge for generalizing CLIP-like models has not been fully explored. To\nbridge this gap, we propose a general and concise TransAgent framework, which\ntransports the knowledge of the isolated agents in a unified manner, and\neffectively guides CLIP to generalize with multi-source knowledge distillation.\nWith such a distinct framework, we flexibly collaborate with 11 heterogeneous\nagents to empower vision-language foundation models, without further cost in\nthe inference phase. Finally, our TransAgent achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on 11 visual recognition datasets. Under the same low-shot setting,\nit outperforms the popular CoOp with around 10% on average, and 20% on EuroSAT\nwhich contains large domain shifts.",

      "abstract": "Many students struggle with math word problems (MWPs), often finding it\ndifficult to identify key information and select the appropriate mathematical\noperations.Schema-based instruction (SBI) is an evidence-based strategy that\nhelps students categorize problems based on their structure, improving\nproblem-solving accuracy. Building on this, we propose a Schema-Based\nInstruction Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SBI-RAG) framework that\nincorporates a large language model (LLM).Our approach emphasizes step-by-step\nreasoning by leveraging schemas to guide solution generation. We evaluate its\nperformance on the GSM8K dataset, comparing it with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo,\nand introduce a \"reasoning score\" metric to assess solution quality. Our\nfindings suggest that SBI-RAG enhances reasoning clarity and problem-solving\naccuracy, potentially providing educational benefits for students",
