      "abstract": "Large neural networks spend most computation on floating point tensor\nmultiplications. In this work, we find that a floating point multiplier can be\napproximated by one integer adder with high precision. We propose the\nlinear-complexity multiplication L-Mul algorithm that approximates floating\npoint number multiplication with integer addition operations. The new algorithm\ncosts significantly less computation resource than 8-bit floating point\nmultiplication but achieves higher precision. Compared to 8-bit floating point\nmultiplications, the proposed method achieves higher precision but consumes\nsignificantly less bit-level computation. Since multiplying floating point\nnumbers requires substantially higher energy compared to integer addition\noperations, applying the L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware can\npotentially reduce 95% energy cost by element-wise floating point tensor\nmultiplications and 80% energy cost of dot products. We calculated the\ntheoretical error expectation of L-Mul, and evaluated the algorithm on a wide\nrange of textual, visual, and symbolic tasks, including natural language\nunderstanding, structural reasoning, mathematics, and commonsense question\nanswering. Our numerical analysis experiments agree with the theoretical error\nestimation, which indicates that L-Mul with 4-bit mantissa achieves comparable\nprecision as float8_e4m3 multiplications, and L-Mul with 3-bit mantissa\noutperforms float8_e5m2. Evaluation results on popular benchmarks show that\ndirectly applying L-Mul to the attention mechanism is almost lossless. We\nfurther show that replacing all floating point multiplications with 3-bit\nmantissa L-Mul in a transformer model achieves equivalent precision as using\nfloat8_e4m3 as accumulation precision in both fine-tuning and inference.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in both representation learning and function learning\nhave demonstrated substantial promise across diverse domains of artificial\nintelligence. However, the effective integration of these paradigms poses a\nsignificant challenge, particularly in cases where users must manually decide\nwhether to apply a representation learning or function learning model based on\ndataset characteristics. To address this issue, we introduce MLP-KAN, a unified\nmethod designed to eliminate the need for manual model selection. By\nintegrating Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for representation learning and\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for function learning within a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, MLP-KAN dynamically adapts to the\nspecific characteristics of the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance.\nEmbedded within a transformer-based framework, our work achieves remarkable\nresults on four widely-used datasets across diverse domains. Extensive\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates its superior versatility, delivering\ncompetitive performance across both deep representation and function learning\ntasks. These findings highlight the potential of MLP-KAN to simplify the model\nselection process, offering a comprehensive, adaptable solution across various\ndomains.

For example, in education, training novice educators with\nexpert guidance is important for effectiveness but expensive, creating\nsignificant barriers to improving education quality at scale. This challenge\ndisproportionately harms students from under-served communities, who stand to\ngain the most from high-quality education. We introduce Tutor CoPilot, a novel\nHuman-AI approach that leverages a model of expert thinking to provide\nexpert-like guidance to tutors as they tutor. This study is the first\nrandomized controlled trial of a Human-AI system in live tutoring, involving\n900 tutors and 1,800 K-12 students from historically under-served communities.\nFollowing a preregistered analysis plan, we find that students working with\ntutors that have access to Tutor CoPilot are 4 percentage points (p.p.) more\nlikely to master topics (p<0.01). Notably, students of lower-rated tutors\nexperienced the greatest benefit, improving mastery by 9 p.p. We find that\nTutor CoPilot costs only $20 per-tutor annually. We analyze 550,000+ messages\nusing classifiers to identify pedagogical strategies, and find that tutors with\naccess to Tutor CoPilot are more likely to use high-quality strategies to\nfoster student understanding (e.g., asking guiding questions) and less likely\nto give away the answer to the student. Tutor interviews highlight how Tutor\nCoPilot's guidance helps tutors to respond to student needs, though they flag\nissues in Tutor CoPilot, such as generating suggestions that are not\ngrade-level appropriate.

Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's\ncontext buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute\nrequirements during inference.

      "abstract": "The current large auto-regressive models can generate high-quality,\nhigh-resolution images, but these models require hundreds or even thousands of\nsteps of next-token prediction during inference, resulting in substantial time\nconsumption. In existing studies, Jacobi decoding, an iterative parallel\ndecoding algorithm, has been used to accelerate the auto-regressive generation\nand can be executed without training. However, the Jacobi decoding relies on a\ndeterministic criterion to determine the convergence of iterations. Thus, it\nworks for greedy decoding but is incompatible with sampling-based decoding\nwhich is crucial for visual quality and diversity in the current\nauto-regressive text-to-image generation. In this paper, we propose a\ntraining-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm, Speculative Jacobi\nDecoding (SJD), to accelerate auto-regressive text-to-image generation. By\nintroducing a probabilistic convergence criterion, our SJD accelerates the\ninference of auto-regressive text-to-image generation while maintaining the\nrandomness in sampling-based token decoding and allowing the model to generate\ndiverse images. Specifically, SJD facilitates the model to predict multiple\ntokens at each step and accepts tokens based on the probabilistic criterion,\nenabling the model to generate images with fewer steps than the conventional\nnext-token-prediction paradigm. We also investigate the token initialization\nstrategies that leverage the spatial locality of visual data to further improve\nthe acceleration ratio under specific scenarios. We conduct experiments for our\nproposed SJD on multiple auto-regressive text-to-image generation models,\nshowing the effectiveness of model acceleration without sacrificing the visual\nquality.",

While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks,\nincluding quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address\nlong-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of\nlarge and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and\ntemporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it\nwell-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is\na significant improvement over transformers.

Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data,\nimproving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes.

Crucially, while existing works rely on rule-based post-processing to\ncircumvent this weakness, such methods are not practically usable in\nopen-domain code completion tasks as they depend on restrictive,\ndataset-specific assumptions (e.g., generating the same number of lines as in\nthe ground truth). Moreover, model performance on FIM tasks deteriorates\nsignificantly without these unrealistic assumptions.\n  We hypothesize that NTP alone is insufficient for models to learn effective\nplanning conditioned on the distant right context, a critical factor for\nsuccessful code infilling. To overcome this, we propose Horizon-Length\nPrediction (HLP), a novel training objective that teaches models to predict the\nnumber of remaining middle tokens (i.e., horizon length) at each step. HLP\nadvances FIM with lookahead planning, enabling models to inherently learn\ninfilling boundaries for arbitrary left and right contexts without relying on\ndataset-specific post-processing. Our evaluation across different models and\nsizes shows that HLP significantly improves FIM performance by up to 24%\nrelatively on diverse benchmarks, across file-level and repository-level, and\nwithout resorting to unrealistic post-processing methods.
