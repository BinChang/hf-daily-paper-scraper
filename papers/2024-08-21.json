      "abstract": "We introduce Transfusion, a recipe for training a multi-modal model over\ndiscrete and continuous data. Transfusion combines the language modeling loss\nfunction (next token prediction) with diffusion to train a single transformer\nover mixed-modality sequences. We pretrain multiple Transfusion models up to 7B\nparameters from scratch on a mixture of text and image data, establishing\nscaling laws with respect to a variety of uni- and cross-modal benchmarks. Our\nexperiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing\nimages and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing\nmodality-specific encoding and decoding layers, we can further improve the\nperformance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16\npatches. We further demonstrate that scaling our Transfusion recipe to 7B\nparameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images\nand text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models,\nreaping the benefits of both worlds.",

In this\nwork, we systematically investigate the impact of code data on general\nperformance.

Across settings, we\nfind a consistent results that code is a critical building block for\ngeneralization far beyond coding tasks and improvements to code quality have an\noutsized impact across all tasks. In particular, compared to text-only\npre-training, the addition of code results in up to relative increase of 8.2%\nin natural language (NL) reasoning, 4.2% in world knowledge, 6.6% improvement\nin generative win-rates, and a 12x boost in code performance respectively.

Specifically, we employ an innovative truncate\nand relay strategy to bridge the denoising processes across different\nresolutions, allowing for high-resolution image generation in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner.

Automated red-teaming methods play a key role\nin this process by generating adversarial attacks to identify and mitigate\npotential vulnerabilities in these models. However, existing methods often\nstruggle with slow performance, limited categorical diversity, and high\nresource demands. While Rainbow Teaming, a recent approach, addresses the\ndiversity challenge by framing adversarial prompt generation as a\nquality-diversity search, it remains slow and requires a large fine-tuned\nmutator for optimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nFerret, a novel approach that builds upon Rainbow Teaming by generating\nmultiple adversarial prompt mutations per iteration and using a scoring\nfunction to rank and select the most effective adversarial prompt. We explore\nvarious scoring functions, including reward models, Llama Guard, and\nLLM-as-a-judge, to rank adversarial mutations based on their potential harm to\nimprove the efficiency of the search for harmful mutations. Our results\ndemonstrate that Ferret, utilizing a reward model as a scoring function,\nimproves the overall attack success rate (ASR) to 95%, which is 46% higher than\nRainbow Teaming. Additionally, Ferret reduces the time needed to achieve a 90%\nASR by 15.2% compared to the baseline and generates adversarial prompts that\nare transferable i.e. effective on other LLMs of larger size.

In response, companies like Meta and\nGoogle have intensified their efforts to implement watermarking techniques on\nAI-generated images to curb the circulation of potentially misleading visuals.\nHowever, in this paper, we argue that current image watermarking methods are\nfragile and susceptible to being circumvented through visual paraphrase\nattacks. The proposed visual paraphraser operates in two steps. First, it\ngenerates a caption for the given image using KOSMOS-2, one of the latest\nstate-of-the-art image captioning systems. Second, it passes both the original\nimage and the generated caption to an image-to-image diffusion system. During\nthe denoising step of the diffusion pipeline, the system generates a visually\nsimilar image that is guided by the text caption. The resulting image is a\nvisual paraphrase and is free of any watermarks. Our empirical findings\ndemonstrate that visual paraphrase attacks can effectively remove watermarks\nfrom images. This paper provides a critical assessment, empirically revealing\nthe vulnerability of existing watermarking techniques to visual paraphrase\nattacks. While we do not propose solutions to this issue, this paper serves as\na call to action for the scientific community to prioritize the development of\nmore robust watermarking techniques.

Current\nevent-based tracking algorithms are gradually hitting their performance\nbottlenecks, due to the utilization of vision Transformer and the static\ntemplate for target object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMamba-based visual tracking framework that adopts the state space model with\nlinear complexity as a backbone network. The search regions and target template\nare fed into the vision Mamba network for simultaneous feature extraction and\ninteraction. The output tokens of search regions will be fed into the tracking\nhead for target localization. More importantly, we consider introducing a\ndynamic template update strategy into the tracking framework using the Memory\nMamba network. By considering the diversity of samples in the target template\nlibrary and making appropriate adjustments to the template memory module, a\nmore effective dynamic template can be integrated. The effective combination of\ndynamic and static templates allows our Mamba-based tracking algorithm to\nachieve a good balance between accuracy and computational cost on multiple\nlarge-scale datasets, including EventVOT, VisEvent, and FE240hz.

The analysis shows that 89.56\\% of posts related to Apollo Go are\nclustered in July.

Attitudes varied significantly among\nprovinces, with Xinjiang and Qinghai showing optimism and Tibet and Gansu\nexpressing concerns about the impact on traditional taxi services.\n  Sentiment analysis revealed that positive comments focused on technology\napplications and personal experiences, while negative comments centered on job\ndisplacement and safety concerns.
