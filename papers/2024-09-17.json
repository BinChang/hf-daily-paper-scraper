Our unified\nframework leverages both auto-regressive language modeling and diffusion\napproaches to support two key music creation workflows: controlled\nmusic generation and post-production editing. For controlled music\ngeneration, our system enables vocal music generation with performance controls\nfrom multi-modal inputs, including style descriptions, audio references,\nmusical scores, and voice prompts.

      "abstract": "Transformers stand as the cornerstone of mordern deep learning.\nTraditionally, these models rely on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers to mix\nthe information between channels. In this paper, we introduce the\nKolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), a novel architecture that replaces MLP\nlayers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers to enhance the\nexpressiveness and performance of the model. Integrating KANs into\ntransformers, however, is no easy feat, especially when scaled up.\nSpecifically, we identify three key challenges: (C1) Base function. The\nstandard B-spline function used in KANs is not optimized for parallel computing\non modern hardware, resulting in slower inference speeds. (C2) Parameter and\nComputation Inefficiency. KAN requires a unique function for each input-output\npair, making the computation extremely large. (C3) Weight initialization. The\ninitialization of weights in KANs is particularly challenging due to their\nlearnable activation functions, which are critical for achieving convergence in\ndeep neural networks. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose\nthree key solutions: (S1) Rational basis. We replace B-spline functions with\nrational functions to improve compatibility with modern GPUs. By implementing\nthis in CUDA, we achieve faster computations. (S2) Group KAN. We share the\nactivation weights through a group of neurons, to reduce the computational load\nwithout sacrificing performance. (S3) Variance-preserving initialization. We\ncarefully initialize the activation weights to make sure that the activation\nvariance is maintained across layers. With these designs, KAT scales\neffectively and readily outperforms traditional MLP-based transformers.",

      "abstract": "Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important\nin various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).",

Comics, as a medium, combine rich visual and textual\nnarratives, challenging AI models with tasks that span image classification,\nobject detection, instance segmentation, and deeper narrative comprehension\nthrough sequential panels. However, the unique structure of comics --\ncharacterized by creative variations in style, reading order, and non-linear\nstorytelling -- presents a set of challenges distinct from those in other\nvisual-language domains. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\nComics Understanding from both dataset and task perspectives. Our contributions\nare fivefold: (1) We analyze the structure of the comics medium, detailing its\ndistinctive compositional elements; (2) We survey the widely used datasets and\ntasks in comics research, emphasizing their role in advancing the field; (3) We\nintroduce the Layer of Comics Understanding (LoCU) framework, a novel taxonomy\nthat redefines vision-language tasks within comics and lays the foundation for\nfuture work; (4) We provide a detailed review and categorization of existing\nmethods following the LoCU framework; (5) Finally, we highlight current\nresearch challenges and propose directions for future exploration, particularly\nin the context of vision-language models applied to comics.

Unfortunately, fine-tuning these models at scale, especially in\nfederated settings where data privacy and communication efficiency are\ncritical, presents significant challenges. Existing methods often resort to\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to mitigate communication overhead, but\nthis typically comes at the cost of model accuracy. To address these\nlimitations, we propose federated full-parameter tuning at scale for LLMs\n(Ferret), the first first-order method with shared randomness to enable\nscalable full-parameter tuning of LLMs across decentralized data sources while\nmaintaining competitive model accuracy. Ferret accomplishes this through three\naspects: (1) it employs widely applied first-order methods for efficient local\nupdates; (2) it projects these updates into a low-dimensional space to\nconsiderably reduce communication overhead; and (3) it reconstructs local\nupdates from this low-dimensional space with shared randomness to facilitate\neffective full-parameter global aggregation, ensuring fast convergence and\ncompetitive final performance. Our rigorous theoretical analyses and insights\nalong with extensive experiments, show that Ferret significantly enhances the\nscalability of existing federated full-parameter tuning approaches by achieving\nhigh computational efficiency, reduced communication overhead, and fast\nconvergence, all while maintaining competitive model accuracy.

Each node in the diagram corresponds to a proposition that\nhas been proposed, critiqued, refined, or verified, enabling the LLM to\niteratively improve its reasoning through natural language feedback.

Furthermore, we\nformalize the DoT framework using Topos Theory, providing a mathematical\nfoundation that ensures logical consistency and soundness in the reasoning\nprocess. This approach enhances both the training and inference processes\nwithin a single LLM, eliminating the need for multiple models or external\ncontrol mechanisms.

In this\npaper, we propose a simple but effective method to improve ZSAC with CLAP.\nSpecifically, we shift from the conventional method of using prompts with\nabstract category labels (e.g., Sound of an organ) to prompts that describe\nsounds using their inherent descriptive features in a diverse context (e.g.,The\norgan's deep and resonant tones filled the cathedral.). To achieve this, we\nfirst propose ReCLAP, a CLAP model trained with rewritten audio captions for\nimproved understanding of sounds in the wild. These rewritten captions describe\neach sound event in the original caption using their unique discriminative\ncharacteristics. ReCLAP outperforms all baselines on both multi-modal\naudio-text retrieval and ZSAC. Next, to improve zero-shot audio classification\nwith ReCLAP, we propose prompt augmentation. In contrast to the traditional\nmethod of employing hand-written template prompts, we generate custom prompts\nfor each unique label in the dataset. These custom prompts first describe the\nsound event in the label and then employ them in diverse scenes.

While direct policy optimization\nmethods exist, state-of-the-art LLMs adopt RL-based methods (usually PPO) in\nRLHF to train the policy to generate good responses guided by a reward model\nlearned from preference data. The main challenge of these methods is the\ninaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation\ntasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that\nthe reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with\ndifferent rewards.

To choose a\nproper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of\ndetermination (R^2) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples\nserves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies.
