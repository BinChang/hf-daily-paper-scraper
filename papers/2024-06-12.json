      "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative models have highlighted the crucial role of\nimage tokenization in the efficient synthesis of high-resolution images.\nTokenization, which transforms images into latent representations, reduces\ncomputational demands compared to directly processing pixels and enhances the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the generation process. Prior methods, such as\nVQGAN, typically utilize 2D latent grids with fixed downsampling factors.\nHowever, these 2D tokenizations face challenges in managing the inherent\nredundancies present in images, where adjacent regions frequently display\nsimilarities. To overcome this issue, we introduce Transformer-based\n1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TiTok), an innovative approach that tokenizes images\ninto 1D latent sequences. TiTok provides a more compact latent representation,\nyielding substantially more efficient and effective representations than\nconventional techniques. For example, a 256 x 256 x 3 image can be reduced to\njust 32 discrete tokens, a significant reduction from the 256 or 1024 tokens\nobtained by prior methods. Despite its compact nature, TiTok achieves\ncompetitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, using the\nsame generator framework, TiTok attains 1.97 gFID, outperforming MaskGIT\nbaseline significantly by 4.21 at ImageNet 256 x 256 benchmark. The advantages\nof TiTok become even more significant when it comes to higher resolution. At\nImageNet 512 x 512 benchmark, TiTok not only outperforms state-of-the-art\ndiffusion model DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.74 vs. 3.04), but also reduces the image\ntokens by 64x, leading to 410x faster generation process. Our best-performing\nvariant can significantly surpasses DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.13 vs. 3.04) while still\ngenerating high-quality samples 74x faster.",

In this work, we present a new\nform of editing, termed imitative editing, to help users exercise their\ncreativity more conveniently. Concretely, to edit an image region of interest,\nusers are free to directly draw inspiration from some in-the-wild references\n(e.g., some relative pictures come across online), without having to cope with\nthe fit between the reference and the source. Such a design requires the system\nto automatically figure out what to expect from the reference to perform the\nediting. For this purpose, we propose a generative training framework, dubbed\nMimicBrush, which randomly selects two frames from a video clip, masks some\nregions of one frame, and learns to recover the masked regions using the\ninformation from the other frame. That way, our model, developed from a\ndiffusion prior, is able to capture the semantic correspondence between\nseparate images in a self-supervised manner. We experimentally show the\neffectiveness of our method under various test cases as well as its superiority\nover existing alternatives.

Inspired by this, we introduce TextGrad, a powerful\nframework performing automatic ``differentiation'' via text. TextGrad\nbackpropagates textual feedback provided by LLMs to improve individual\ncomponents of a compound AI system.

It works\nout-of-the-box for a variety of tasks, where the users only provide the\nobjective function without tuning components or prompts of the framework. We\nshowcase TextGrad's effectiveness and generality across a diverse range of\napplications, from question answering and molecule optimization to radiotherapy\ntreatment planning.

      "abstract": "Complex multi-step reasoning tasks, such as solving mathematical problems or\ngenerating code, remain a significant hurdle for even the most advanced large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Verifying LLM outputs with an Outcome Reward Model\n(ORM) is a standard inference-time technique aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nperformance of LLMs. However, this still proves insufficient for reasoning\ntasks with a lengthy or multi-hop reasoning chain, where the intermediate\noutcomes are neither properly rewarded nor penalized. Process supervision\naddresses this limitation by assigning intermediate rewards during the\nreasoning process. To date, the methods used to collect process supervision\ndata have relied on either human annotation or per-step Monte Carlo estimation,\nboth prohibitively expensive to scale, thus hindering the broad application of\nthis technique. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel\ndivide-and-conquer style Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm named\nOmegaPRM for the efficient collection of high-quality process\nsupervision data. This algorithm swiftly identifies the first error in the\nChain of Thought (CoT) with binary search and balances the positive and\nnegative examples, thereby ensuring both efficiency and quality. As a result,\nwe are able to collect over 1.5 million process supervision annotations to\ntrain a Process Reward Model (PRM).

      "abstract": "Diffusion models have garnered significant interest from the community for\ntheir great generative ability across various applications. However, their\ntypical multi-step sequential-denoising nature gives rise to high cumulative\nlatency, thereby precluding the possibilities of parallel computation. To\naddress this, we introduce AsyncDiff, a universal and plug-and-play\nacceleration scheme that enables model parallelism across multiple devices. Our\napproach divides the cumbersome noise prediction model into multiple\ncomponents, assigning each to a different device. To break the dependency chain\nbetween these components, it transforms the conventional sequential denoising\ninto an asynchronous process by exploiting the high similarity between hidden\nstates in consecutive diffusion steps. Consequently, each component is\nfacilitated to compute in parallel on separate devices. The proposed strategy\nsignificantly reduces inference latency while minimally impacting the\ngenerative quality. Specifically, for the Stable Diffusion v2.1, AsyncDiff\nachieves a 2.7x speedup with negligible degradation and a 4.0x speedup with\nonly a slight reduction of 0.38 in CLIP Score, on four NVIDIA A5000 GPUs.

To\nhandle inconsistencies in the freeze-time video, we jointly learn a per-frame\ndeformation to model these imperfections. We then learn the temporal\ndeformation based on the canonical representation to capture dynamic\ninteractions in the reference video.
