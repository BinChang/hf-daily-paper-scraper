      "abstract": "Recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have opened\nnew avenues for applications in Embodied AI. Building on previous work,\nEgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\negocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs\nand low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks:\nvideo question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward\nmodeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data\ngeneration pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge\nand multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the\ngenerated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink\nbenchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models:\nAPI-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based\nMLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform\npoorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These\nfindings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements\nto be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In\nconclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for\negocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and\ninteraction in the complex real-world environments.",

      "abstract": "Coding tasks have been valuable for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs),\nas they demand the comprehension of high-level instructions, complex reasoning,\nand the implementation of functional programs -- core capabilities for\nadvancing Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the progress in Large\nMultimodal Models (LMMs), which extend LLMs with visual perception and\nunderstanding capabilities, there remains a notable lack of coding benchmarks\nthat rigorously assess these models, particularly in tasks that emphasize\nvisual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce HumanEval-V, a novel and\nlightweight benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' visual\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities through code generation. HumanEval-V\nincludes 108 carefully crafted, entry-level Python coding tasks derived from\nplatforms like CodeForces and Stack Overflow. Each task is adapted by modifying\nthe context and algorithmic patterns of the original problems, with visual\nelements redrawn to ensure distinction from the source, preventing potential\ndata leakage. LMMs are required to complete the code solution based on the\nprovided visual context and a predefined Python function signature outlining\nthe task requirements. Every task is equipped with meticulously handcrafted\ntest cases to ensure a thorough and reliable evaluation of model-generated\nsolutions. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LMMs using HumanEval-V, uncovering\nsignificant challenges. Proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve only 13% pass@1\nand 36.4% pass@10, while open-weight models with 70B parameters score below 4%\npass@1. Ablation studies further reveal the limitations of current LMMs in\nvision reasoning and coding capabilities. These results underscore key areas\nfor future research to enhance LMMs' capabilities.

This paper presents the first\nsystematic investigation of hallucinations in LMMs involving the three most\ncommon modalities: language, visual, and audio. Our study reveals two key\ncontributors to hallucinations: overreliance on unimodal priors and spurious\ninter-modality correlations.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their\npowerful reasoning capabilities has reignited interest in autonomous planning\nby automatically generating reasonable solutions for given tasks. However,\nprior research and our experiments show that current language agents still lack\nhuman-level planning abilities. Even the state-of-the-art reasoning model,\nOpenAI o1, achieves only 15.6% on one of the complex real-world planning\nbenchmarks. This highlights a critical question: What hinders language agents\nfrom achieving human-level planning? Although existing studies have highlighted\nweak performance in agent planning, the deeper underlying issues and the\nmechanisms and limitations of the strategies proposed to address them remain\ninsufficiently understood. In this work, we apply the feature attribution study\nand identify two key factors that hinder agent planning: the limited role of\nconstraints and the diminishing influence of questions.

While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable\ninsights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to\ntheir \\( O(n^3) \\) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To\nmitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only\nserves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also\nprovides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive\ndiscriminability and diversity. By employing the \\( L_{1,2}-norm \\) to\nfurther approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's\ninformation compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexity\nto \\( O(n^2) \\) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, the\nMatrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy\nfor the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. This\nperformance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in\ntests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks\nand model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a\nreliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance,\nstriking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

However, as text\ninputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and\naligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle\nthese issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding\nmethod for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization\nmethod for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts\nare divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method\novercomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For\npreference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to\nfine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference\nmodels for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that\nthe preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant\npart that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other\nvisual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the\ntext-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during\nfine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns\ndifferent weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and\nenhancing alignment.

In addition,\nusers may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety\nstandards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned.\n  We propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to\nadapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training.

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation\nand memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important\ntokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific\ndistribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby\nimproving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance\nfor more challenging ones.

To mitigate the memory\nbottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the\nKV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens,\nwhile low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance.

Contrary to\ncrafting separate models for different architectures or sizes, NeuMeta directly\nlearns the continuous weight manifold of neural networks. Once trained, we can\nsample weights for any-sized network directly from the manifold, even for\npreviously unseen configurations, without retraining. To achieve this ambitious\ngoal, NeuMeta trains neural implicit functions as hypernetworks. They accept\ncoordinates within the model space as input, and generate corresponding weight\nvalues on the manifold. In other words, the implicit function is learned in a\nway, that the predicted weights is well-performed across various models sizes.\nIn training those models, we notice that, the final performance closely relates\non smoothness of the learned manifold. In pursuit of enhancing this smoothness,\nwe employ two strategies. First, we permute weight matrices to achieve\nintra-model smoothness, by solving the Shortest Hamiltonian Path problem.\nBesides, we add a noise on the input coordinates when training the implicit\nfunction, ensuring models with various sizes shows consistent outputs. As such,\nNeuMeta shows promising results in synthesizing parameters for various network\nconfigurations. Our extensive tests in image classification, semantic\nsegmentation, and image generation reveal that NeuMeta sustains full-size\nperformance even at a 75% compression rate.",

This paper\nintroduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We\nconduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting\nreward models that achieve up to 80.40% accuracy in predicting human\npreferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of\nreward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and\npotential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward\nmodels can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved\nperformance on toxicity benchmarks.

However, these models continue to struggle\nwith fine-grained, cross-modal temporal understanding, particularly when\ncorrelating events across audio and video streams. We address these challenges\nwith two key contributions: a new dataset and model, called OCTAV and OMCAT\nrespectively. OCTAV (Omni Context and Temporal Audio Video) is a novel dataset\ndesigned to capture event transitions across audio and video. Second, OMCAT\n(Omni Context Aware Transformer) is a powerful model that leverages RoTE\n(Rotary Time Embeddings), an innovative extension of RoPE, to enhance temporal\ngrounding and computational efficiency in time-anchored tasks. Through a robust\nthree-stage training pipeline-feature alignment, instruction tuning, and\nOCTAV-specific training-OMCAT excels in cross-modal temporal understanding. Our\nmodel demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Audio-Visual Question\nAnswering (AVQA) tasks and the OCTAV benchmark, showcasing significant gains in\ntemporal reasoning and cross-modal alignment, as validated through\ncomprehensive experiments and ablation studies. Our dataset and code will be\nmade publicly available. The link to our demo page is https://om-cat.github.io.",

      "abstract": "Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more\ngranular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However,\nsuch methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the\nintermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the\nspectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to\ncombine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high\ndegree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code\ngeneration and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise\nstrictly. We introduce Faithful Logic-Aided\nReasoning and Exploration (\\ours), a novel\ninterpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task\ndecompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query\ninto facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code\nexecution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our\nmethod allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t.\nthe generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without\nrelying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on 7\nout of 9 diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model\nfaithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further\ndemonstrate that {\\ours} allows pinpointing the decisive factors\nsufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during\nthe multi-hop search.",

      "abstract": "Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of\nthe model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies\npoint out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nshow that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\nare overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we\nreveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in\ntheir own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence\nand demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nexhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual\nquality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants:\nPPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated\nReward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model\ntraining, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment\nbetween response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward\nscore during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the\nmoving average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly\nintegrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden\nlabels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six\ndiverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation.\nExperiment results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration\nerror and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that\nthey do not compromise model capabilities in open-ended conversation settings.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the\ndevelopment of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents\nand agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and\nsystems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains\nthe traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise\ncommands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as\nusers are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic\nfile names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file\nsystem ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional\napproaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with\nfiles through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management.\nAt the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file\nmanagement functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update\nmonitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level,\nwe store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement\nsyscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered\nby vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant\nimprovements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the\ndiversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file\noperations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more\nintelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version\ncomparison, further enhancing its capabilities.",
