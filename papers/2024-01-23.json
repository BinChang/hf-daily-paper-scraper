      "abstract": "Detecting text generated by modern large language models is thought to be\nhard, as both LLMs and humans can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors.\nHowever, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language\nmodels is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated\ntext. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only\nrequires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method,\ncalled Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training\ndata. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs\nwithout any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate\nBinoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide\nrange of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from\nChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being\ntrained on any ChatGPT data.",

However, existing methods often face challenges when\nhandling complex text prompts that involve multiple objects with multiple\nattributes and relationships. In this paper, we propose a brand new\ntraining-free text-to-image generation/editing framework, namely Recaption,\nPlan and Generate (RPG), harnessing the powerful chain-of-thought reasoning\nability of multimodal LLMs to enhance the compositionality of text-to-image\ndiffusion models. Our approach employs the MLLM as a global planner to\ndecompose the process of generating complex images into multiple simpler\ngeneration tasks within subregions. We propose complementary regional diffusion\nto enable region-wise compositional generation. Furthermore, we integrate\ntext-guided image generation and editing within the proposed RPG in a\nclosed-loop fashion, thereby enhancing generalization ability. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate our RPG outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image\ndiffusion models, including DALL-E 3 and SDXL, particularly in multi-category\nobject composition and text-image semantic alignment. Notably, our RPG\nframework exhibits wide compatibility with various MLLM architectures (e.g.,\nMiniGPT-4) and diffusion backbones (e.g., ControlNet).

These questions span 30 subjects and\ncomprise 39 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps,\ntables, music sheets, and chemical structures.\n  CMMMU focuses on complex perception and reasoning with domain-specific\nknowledge in the Chinese context.

Recent advances in the development of vision-language\nfoundation models (FMs) give rise to the possibility of performing automated\nCXR interpretation, which can assist physicians with clinical decision-making\nand improve patient outcomes. However, developing FMs that can accurately\ninterpret CXRs is challenging due to the (1) limited availability of\nlarge-scale vision-language datasets in the medical image domain, (2) lack of\nvision and language encoders that can capture the complexities of medical data,\nand (3) absence of evaluation frameworks for benchmarking the abilities of FMs\non CXR interpretation. In this work, we address these challenges by first\nintroducing CheXinstruct - a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset\ncurated from 28 publicly-available datasets. We then present CheXagent -\nan instruction-tuned FM capable of analyzing and summarizing CXRs. To build\nCheXagent, we design a clinical large language model (LLM) for parsing\nradiology reports, a vision encoder for representing CXR images, and a network\nto bridge the vision and language modalities. Finally, we introduce\nCheXbench - a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate FMs\nacross 8 clinically-relevant CXR interpretation tasks.

To address this question, we leverage the semantic knowledge\nextracted from Stable Diffusion (SD) and aim to develop an image segmentor\ncapable of generating fine-grained segmentation maps without any additional\ntraining. The primary difficulty stems from the fact that semantically\nmeaningful feature maps typically exist only in the spatially lower-dimensional\nlayers, which poses a challenge in directly extracting pixel-level semantic\nrelations from these feature maps. To overcome this issue, our framework\nidentifies semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations\nof low-dimensional feature maps by exploiting SD's generation process and\nutilizes them for constructing image-resolution segmentation maps. In extensive\nexperiments, the produced segmentation maps are demonstrated to be well\ndelineated and capture detailed parts of the images, indicating the existence\nof highly accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models.",

To address the potential performance\ndegradation from the incomplete context in streaming processing, we enhance the\ncontext-awareness of the LM through two strategies: 1) teacher-guided context\nforesight, using a teacher model to summarize the present and future semantic\ncontext during training to guide the model's forecasting for missing context;\n2) semantic masking strategy, promoting acoustic prediction from preceding\ncorrupted semantic and acoustic input, enhancing context-learning ability.\nNotably, StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without\nany future look-ahead.

Although\nhigh quality registration of person-specific avatars to headset-mounted camera\n(HMC) images is possible in an offline setting, the performance of generic\nrealtime models are significantly degraded. Online registration is also\nchallenging due to oblique camera views and differences in modality. In this\nwork, we first show that the domain gap between the avatar and headset-camera\nimages is one of the primary sources of difficulty, where a transformer-based\narchitecture achieves high accuracy on domain-consistent data, but degrades\nwhen the domain-gap is re-introduced.

These two modules reinforce each other, as image\nstyle transfer becomes easier when close-to-ground-truth examples are shown,\nand better domain-gap removal helps registration.
