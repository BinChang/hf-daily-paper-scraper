      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting\nthem to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents\nchallenges. A key issue is the difficulty in smoothly connecting individual\nentities in low-level observations with abstract concepts required for\nplanning. A common approach to address this problem is through the use of\nhierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down\ntasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language and\nimagined observations. However, language often fails to effectively convey\nspatial information, while generating future images with sufficient accuracy\nremains challenging. To address these limitations, we propose visual-temporal\ncontext prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy\nmodels. This protocol leverages object segmentation from both past and present\nobservations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we\ntrain ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated\nvisual observations and segmentation masks, with real-time object tracking\nprovided by SAM-2. Our method unlocks the full potential of VLMs\nvisual-language reasoning abilities, enabling them to solve complex creative\ntasks, especially those heavily reliant on spatial understanding. Experiments\nin Minecraft demonstrate that our approach allows agents to accomplish\npreviously unattainable tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of\nvisual-temporal context prompting in embodied decision-making.

We therefore introduce SALAD, a per-token\nlatent diffusion model for zero-shot text-to-speech, that operates on\ncontinuous representations. SALAD builds upon the recently proposed expressive\ndiffusion head for image generation, and extends it to generate variable-length\noutputs. Our approach utilizes semantic tokens for providing contextual\ninformation and determining the stopping condition. We suggest three continuous\nvariants for our method, extending popular discrete speech synthesis\ntechniques. Additionally, we implement discrete baselines for each variant and\nconduct a comparative analysis of discrete versus continuous speech modeling\ntechniques. Our results demonstrate that both continuous and discrete\napproaches are highly competent, and that SALAD achieves a superior\nintelligibility score while obtaining speech quality and speaker similarity on\npar with the ground-truth audio.",

Existing automatic interpretation methods suffer\nfrom limited generalizability, focusing on a narrow range of cardiac\nconditions, and typically depend on raw physiological signals, which may not be\nreadily available in resource-limited settings where only printed or digital\nECG images are accessible. Recent advancements in multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) present promising opportunities for addressing these challenges.\nHowever, the application of MLLMs to ECG image interpretation remains\nchallenging due to the lack of instruction tuning datasets and well-established\nECG image benchmarks for quantitative evaluation. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce ECGInstruct, a comprehensive ECG image instruction tuning dataset\nof over one million samples, covering a wide range of ECG-related tasks from\ndiverse data sources. Using ECGInstruct, we develop PULSE, an MLLM tailored for\nECG image comprehension. In addition, we curate ECGBench, a new evaluation\nbenchmark covering four key ECG image interpretation tasks across nine\ndifferent datasets.

Despite their benefits,\nMoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient\nmemory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices\nbetween the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the\nconventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive\nin terms of cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Read-ME that\ntransforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to\n\"upcycling\" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training.\nOur approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts.

Our codesign therefore\naddresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing\na scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained\nsettings.

Traditionally, expert\nannotations ensure high-quality labels; however, the cost of expert annotation\ndoes not scale well with the growing demand for larger datasets required by\nmodern models. While crowd-sourcing provides a more scalable solution, it often\ncomes at the expense of annotation precision and consistency. Recent\nadvancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance\nthe annotation process, particularly for detecting label errors in existing\ndatasets. In this work, we consider the recent approach of LLM-as-a-judge,\nleveraging an ensemble of LLMs to flag potentially mislabeled examples. Through\na case study of four datasets from the TRUE benchmark, covering different tasks\nand domains, we empirically analyze the labeling quality of existing datasets,\nand compare expert, crowd-sourced, and our LLM-based annotations in terms of\nagreement, label quality, and efficiency, demonstrating the strengths and\nlimitations of each annotation method. Our findings reveal a substantial number\nof label errors, which, when corrected, induce a significant upward shift in\nreported model performance. This suggests that many of the LLMs so-called\nmistakes are due to label errors rather than genuine model failures.\nAdditionally, we discuss the implications of mislabeled data and propose\nmethods to mitigate them in training to improve model performance.",

      "abstract": "Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models\n(LMs) with human preferences. However, directly collecting human preferences\ncan be expensive, time-consuming, and can have high variance. An appealing\nalternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic\nannotations as they are more consistent, cheaper, and scale better than human\nannotation; however, they are also prone to biases and errors. In this work, we\nintroduce a routing framework that combines inputs from humans and LMs to\nachieve better annotation quality, while reducing the total cost of human\nannotation. The crux of our approach is to identify preference instances that\nwill benefit from human annotations. We formulate this as an optimization\nproblem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we train a\nperformance prediction model to predict a reward model's performance on an\narbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and employ a routing strategy\nthat selects a combination that maximizes predicted performance. We train the\nperformance prediction model on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10K\ninstances paired with human and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid\nmixture of LM and direct human preferences using our routing framework achieves\nbetter reward model performance compared to using either one exclusively. We\nsimulate selective human preference collection on three other datasets and show\nthat our method generalizes well to all three. We analyze features from the\nrouting model to identify characteristics of instances that can benefit from\nhuman feedback, e.g., prompts with a moderate safety concern or moderate intent\ncomplexity.

Counting, a\nfundamental component of many reasoning tasks, also requires reasoning depth to\ngrow linearly to be performed inductively. While previous studies have\nestablished the upper limits of counting ability in Transformer-based expert\nmodels (i.e., models specifically trained for counting tasks), these findings\ndo not directly extend to general-purpose LLMs due to differences in reasoning\nmechanisms.

In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can identify knowledge\nconflicts and whether it is possible to know which source of knowledge the\nmodel will rely on by analysing the residual stream of the LLM. Through probing\ntasks, we find that LLMs can internally register the signal of knowledge\nconflict in the residual stream, which can be accurately detected by probing\nthe intermediate model activations. This allows us to detect conflicts within\nthe residual stream before generating the answers without modifying the input\nor model parameters. Moreover, we find that the residual stream shows\nsignificantly different patterns when the model relies on contextual knowledge\nversus parametric knowledge to resolve conflicts. This pattern can be employed\nto estimate the behaviour of LLMs when conflict happens and prevent unexpected\nanswers before producing the answers.
