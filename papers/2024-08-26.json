      "abstract": "The field of vision-language models (VLMs), which take images and texts as\ninputs and output texts, is rapidly evolving and has yet to reach consensus on\nseveral key aspects of the development pipeline, including data, architecture,\nand training methods. This paper can be seen as a tutorial for building a VLM.\nWe begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art\napproaches, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each, addressing the\nmajor challenges in the field, and suggesting promising research directions for\nunderexplored areas. We then walk through the practical steps to build\nIdefics3-8B, a powerful VLM that significantly outperforms its predecessor\nIdefics2-8B, while being trained efficiently, exclusively on open datasets, and\nusing a straightforward pipeline. These steps include the creation of Docmatix,\na dataset for improving document understanding capabilities, which is 240 times\nlarger than previously available datasets. We release the model along with the\ndatasets created for its training.",

      "abstract": "Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has\nrecently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we\nobserve that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it\ndifficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real\nworld, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2)\nreliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3)\ninsufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image\nresolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically,\nwe collect more than 300K images from public datasets and the Internet,\nfiltering 13,366 high-quality images for annotation. This involves the\nefforts of professional 25 annotators and 7 experts in MLLMs, contributing\nto 29,429 question-answer pairs that cover 43 subtasks across 5\nreal-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know,\nMME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring\nthe highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We\nfurther conduct a thorough evaluation involving 28 prominent MLLMs, such as\nGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the\nmost advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach\n60% accuracy. The challenges of perceiving high-resolution images and\nunderstanding complex real-world scenarios remain urgent issues to be\naddressed.

A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit\nomnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex\nscene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion\nvia inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene\nenvironments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during\nexpansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle\nthese challenges, we introduce LayerPano3D, a novel framework for full-view,\nexplorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key\ninsight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at\ndifferent depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the\nreference views via diffusion prior. LayerPano3D comprises multiple dedicated\ndesigns: 1) we introduce a novel text-guided anchor view synthesis pipeline for\nhigh-quality, consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D\nPanorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and\nlift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes\nwith unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view\nconsistency and immersive exploratory experience.

These methods leverage the low-rank structure of\ngradients to project optimizer states into a subspace using projection matrix\nfound by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, convergence of these\nalgorithms is highly dependent on the update rules of their projection matrix.\nIn this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for arbitrary\nupdate rules of projection matrix. This guarantee is generally applicable to\noptimizers that can be analyzed with Hamiltonian Descent, including most common\nones, such as LION, Adam. Inspired by our theoretical understanding, we propose\nOnline Subspace Descent, a new family of subspace descent optimizer without\nSVD. Instead of updating the projection matrix with eigenvectors, Online\nSubspace Descent updates the projection matrix with online PCA. Online Subspace\nDescent is flexible and introduces only minimum overhead to training. We show\nthat for the task of pretraining LLaMA models ranging from 60M to 7B parameters\non the C4 dataset, Online Subspace Descent achieves lower perplexity and better\ndownstream tasks performance than state-of-the-art low-rank training methods\nacross different settings and narrows the gap with full-rank baselines.",

      "abstract": "Customized video generation aims to generate high-quality videos guided by\ntext prompts and subject's reference images. However, since it is only trained\non static images, the fine-tuning process of subject learning disrupts\nabilities of video diffusion models (VDMs) to combine concepts and generate\nmotions. To restore these abilities, some methods use additional video similar\nto the prompt to fine-tune or guide the model. This requires frequent changes\nof guiding videos and even re-tuning of the model when generating different\nmotions, which is very inconvenient for users. In this paper, we propose\nCustomCrafter, a novel framework that preserves the model's motion generation\nand conceptual combination abilities without additional video and fine-tuning\nto recovery. For preserving conceptual combination ability, we design a\nplug-and-play module to update few parameters in VDMs, enhancing the model's\nability to capture the appearance details and the ability of concept\ncombinations for new subjects. For motion generation, we observed that VDMs\ntend to restore the motion of video in the early stage of denoising, while\nfocusing on the recovery of subject details in the later stage. Therefore, we\npropose Dynamic Weighted Video Sampling Strategy. Using the pluggability of our\nsubject learning modules, we reduce the impact of this module on motion\ngeneration in the early stage of denoising, preserving the ability to generate\nmotion of VDMs. In the later stage of denoising, we restore this module to\nrepair the appearance details of the specified subject, thereby ensuring the\nfidelity of the subject's appearance.

Processing these excessive visual\ntokens is computationally challenging, especially in resource-constrained\nenvironments with commodity GPUs. To support high-resolution images while\nmeeting resource constraints, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping\n(HiRED), a token-dropping scheme that operates within a fixed token budget\nbefore the Large Language Model (LLM) stage. HiRED can be integrated with\nexisting high-resolution VLMs in a plug-and-play manner, as it requires no\nadditional training while still maintaining superior accuracy. We strategically\nuse the vision encoder's attention in the initial layers to assess the visual\ncontent of each image partition and allocate the token budget accordingly.\nThen, using the attention in the final layer, we select the most important\nvisual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget, dropping the\nrest. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-Next-7B on NVIDIA TESLA P40 GPU, HiRED\nwith a 20% token budget increases token generation throughput by 4.7, reduces\nfirst-token generation latency by 15 seconds, and saves 2.3 GB of GPU memory\nfor a single inference.",

However, conditioning on noisy or Out-of-Distribution\n(OoD) images poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing fidelity\nto the input and realism of the output. We introduce Confident Ordinary\nDifferential Editing (CODE), a novel approach for image synthesis that\neffectively handles OoD guidance images. Utilizing a diffusion model as a\ngenerative prior, CODE enhances images through score-based updates along the\nprobability-flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. This method\nrequires no task-specific training, no handcrafted modules, and no assumptions\nregarding the corruptions affecting the conditioning image. Our method is\ncompatible with any diffusion model. Positioned at the intersection of\nconditional image generation and blind image restoration, CODE operates in a\nfully blind manner, relying solely on a pre-trained generative model. Our\nmethod introduces an alternative approach to blind restoration: instead of\ntargeting a specific ground truth image based on assumptions about the\nunderlying corruption, CODE aims to increase the likelihood of the input image\nwhile maintaining fidelity. This results in the most probable in-distribution\nimage around the input. Our contributions are twofold. First, CODE introduces a\nnovel editing method based on ODE, providing enhanced control, realism, and\nfidelity compared to its SDE-based counterpart. Second, we introduce a\nconfidence interval-based clipping method, which improves CODE's effectiveness\nby allowing it to disregard certain pixels or information, thus enhancing the\nrestoration process in a blind manner.

However,\nsimply reducing the number of Gaussians to accommodate devices with less memory\ncapacity leads to inferior quality compared to the quality that can be achieved\non high-end hardware. To address this lack of scalability, we propose\nintegrating a Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) to 3DGS, to allow a scene to be\nrendered at varying levels of detail according to hardware capabilities. While\nexisting 3DGSs with LoD focus on detailed reconstruction, our method provides\nreconstructions using a small number of Gaussians for reduced memory\nrequirements, and a larger number of Gaussians for greater detail. Experiments\ndemonstrate our various rendering options with tradeoffs between rendering\nquality and memory usage, thereby allowing real-time rendering across different\nmemory constraints.
