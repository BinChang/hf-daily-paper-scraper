However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and\nexpensive to augment them or impart new skills.

In this work, we study the problem of efficient\nand practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific\nmodels to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM --\nComposition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention\nbetween models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.\nSalient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using'\nexisting LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing\nmodel weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and\n(iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmenting\nPaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an\nabsolute improvement of up to 13\\% on tasks like translation into English and\narithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.

We introduce *multi-modal\ninstruction* for image generation, a task representation articulating a range\nof generation intents with precision. It uses natural language to amalgamate\ndisparate modalities (e.g., text, edge, style, subject, etc.), such that\nabundant generation intents can be standardized in a uniform format.\n  We then build instruct-imagen by fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image\ndiffusion model with a two-stage framework. First, we adapt the model using the\nretrieval-augmented training, to enhance model's capabilities to ground its\ngeneration on external multimodal context. Subsequently, we fine-tune the\nadapted model on diverse image generation tasks that requires vision-language\nunderstanding (e.g., subject-driven generation, etc.), each paired with a\nmulti-modal instruction encapsulating the task's essence. Human evaluation on\nvarious image generation datasets reveals that instruct-imagen matches or\nsurpasses prior task-specific models in-domain and demonstrates promising\ngeneralization to unseen and more complex tasks.",

Yet, the\nsignificant memory and computational costs of dense sampling in volume\nrendering have forced 3D GANs to adopt patch-based training or employ\nlow-resolution rendering with post-processing 2D super resolution, which\nsacrifices multiview consistency and the quality of resolved geometry.\nConsequently, 3D GANs have not yet been able to fully resolve the rich 3D\ngeometry present in 2D images. In this work, we propose techniques to scale\nneural volume rendering to the much higher resolution of native 2D images,\nthereby resolving fine-grained 3D geometry with unprecedented detail. Our\napproach employs learning-based samplers for accelerating neural rendering for\n3D GAN training using up to 5 times fewer depth samples. This enables us to\nexplicitly \"render every pixel\" of the full-resolution image during training\nand inference without post-processing superresolution in 2D. Together with our\nstrategy to learn high-quality surface geometry, our method synthesizes\nhigh-resolution 3D geometry and strictly view-consistent images while\nmaintaining image quality on par with baselines relying on post-processing\nsuper resolution.

      "abstract": "State-of-the-art models on contemporary 3D perception benchmarks like ScanNet\nconsume and label dataset-provided 3D point clouds, obtained through post\nprocessing of sensed multiview RGB-D images. They are typically trained\nin-domain, forego large-scale 2D pre-training and outperform alternatives that\nfeaturize the posed RGB-D multiview images instead. The gap in performance\nbetween methods that consume posed images versus post-processed 3D point clouds\nhas fueled the belief that 2D and 3D perception require distinct model\narchitectures. In this paper, we challenge this view and propose ODIN\n(Omni-Dimensional INstance segmentation), a model that can segment and label\nboth 2D RGB images and 3D point clouds, using a transformer architecture that\nalternates between 2D within-view and 3D cross-view information fusion. Our\nmodel differentiates 2D and 3D feature operations through the positional\nencodings of the tokens involved, which capture pixel coordinates for 2D patch\ntokens and 3D coordinates for 3D feature tokens.

One crucial bottleneck of modeling animals is the\nlimited availability of training data, which we overcome by simply learning\nfrom 2D Internet images.

However, such\npoint-based reconstruction may fail to make each predicted pixel/feature fully\npreserve its neighborhood context, impairing diffusion-based image synthesis.\nAs a powerful source of automatic supervisory signal, context has been well\nstudied for learning representations. Inspired by this, we for the first time\npropose ConPreDiff to improve diffusion-based image synthesis with context\nprediction. We explicitly reinforce each point to predict its neighborhood\ncontext (i.e., multi-stride features/tokens/pixels) with a context decoder at\nthe end of diffusion denoising blocks in training stage, and remove the decoder\nfor inference. In this way, each point can better reconstruct itself by\npreserving its semantic connections with neighborhood context. This new\nparadigm of ConPreDiff can generalize to arbitrary discrete and continuous\ndiffusion backbones without introducing extra parameters in sampling procedure.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on unconditional image generation,\ntext-to-image generation and image inpainting tasks.

Visual reasoning with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these\nlimitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set\nof (visual) tools.
