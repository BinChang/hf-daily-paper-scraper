      "abstract": "We propose the problem of conversational web navigation, where a digital\nagent controls a web browser and follows user instructions to solve real-world\ntasks in a multi-turn dialogue fashion. To support this problem, we introduce\nWEBLINX - a large-scale benchmark of 100K interactions across 2300 expert\ndemonstrations of conversational web navigation. Our benchmark covers a broad\nrange of patterns on over 150 real-world websites and can be used to train and\nevaluate agents in diverse scenarios. Due to the magnitude of information\npresent, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot process entire web pages in\nreal-time. To solve this bottleneck, we design a retrieval-inspired model that\nefficiently prunes HTML pages by ranking relevant elements. We use the selected\nelements, along with screenshots and action history, to assess a variety of\nmodels for their ability to replicate human behavior when navigating the web.\nOur experiments span from small text-only to proprietary multimodal LLMs. We\nfind that smaller finetuned decoders surpass the best zero-shot LLMs (including\nGPT-4V), but also larger finetuned multimodal models which were explicitly\npretrained on screenshots. However, all finetuned models struggle to generalize\nto unseen websites. Our findings highlight the need for large multimodal models\nthat can generalize to novel settings.

This work explores how to repurpose\ngeneral LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce\na novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are\nparameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to\ncondition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to\ndelimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide\ndomain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions\n(e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving\ninstructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using\nauxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains\nfrom task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen\nproblems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's\nperformance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or\nchemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert\nmodels tailored to these tasks.",

      "abstract": "Despite the recent advances in personalized text-to-image (P-T2I) generative\nmodels, subject-driven T2I remains challenging. The primary bottlenecks include\n1) Intensive training resource requirements, 2) Hyper-parameter sensitivity\nleading to inconsistent outputs, and 3) Balancing the intricacies of novel\nvisual concept and composition alignment. We start by re-iterating the core\nphilosophy of T2I diffusion models to address the above limitations.\nPredominantly, contemporary subject-driven T2I approaches hinge on Latent\nDiffusion Models (LDMs), which facilitate T2I mapping through cross-attention\nlayers. While LDMs offer distinct advantages, P-T2I methods' reliance on the\nlatent space of these diffusion models significantly escalates resource\ndemands, leading to inconsistent results and necessitating numerous iterations\nfor a single desired image. Recently, ECLIPSE has demonstrated a more\nresource-efficient pathway for training UnCLIP-based T2I models, circumventing\nthe need for diffusion text-to-image priors. Building on this, we introduce\nlambda-ECLIPSE. Our method illustrates that effective P-T2I does not\nnecessarily depend on the latent space of diffusion models. lambda-ECLIPSE\nachieves single, multi-subject, and edge-guided T2I personalization with just\n34M parameters and is trained on a mere 74 GPU hours using 1.6M image-text\ninterleaved data. Through extensive experiments, we also establish that\nlambda-ECLIPSE surpasses existing baselines in composition alignment while\npreserving concept alignment performance, even with significantly lower\nresource utilization.",

      "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the\nstandard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few\ninput-output examples. Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from\ncorrect input-output pairs. In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by\nlearning more from the few given input-output examples. We introduce Learning\nPrinciples (LEAP): First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on\nthese few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit\ntask-specific \"principles\" from them, which help solve similar problems and\navoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test\nquestions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general\nprinciples. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop\nquestion answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning,\nand math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the\nstrongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 turbo and\nClaude-2.1. For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting\nusing GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA.
