      "abstract": "Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos\nthat follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual\ncontent. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video\ngeneration (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively\nextended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of\n80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In\ncontrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation\nwhen applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with\nStreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that\noutperforms competitors with consistency and motion. Our code will be available\nat: https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/StreamingT2V",
