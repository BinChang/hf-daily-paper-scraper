      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance and vast\npotential across diverse tasks. However, the deployment of LLMs with high\nperformance in low-resource environments has garnered significant attention in\nthe industry. When GPU hardware resources are limited, we can explore\nalternative options on CPUs. To mitigate the financial burden and alleviate\nconstraints imposed by hardware resources, optimizing inference performance is\nnecessary. In this paper, we introduce an easily deployable inference\nperformance optimization solution aimed at accelerating LLMs on CPUs. In this\nsolution, we implement an effective way to reduce the KV cache size while\nensuring precision. We propose a distributed inference optimization approach\nand implement it based on oneAPI Collective Communications Library.\nFurthermore, we propose optimization approaches for LLMs on CPU, and conduct\ntailored optimizations for the most commonly used models.

However, existing open LMMs\nlargely focus on single-image tasks, their applications to multi-image\nscenarios remains less explored. Additionally, prior LMM research separately\ntackles different scenarios, leaving it impossible to generalize cross\nscenarios with new emerging capabilities. To this end, we introduce\nLLaVA-NeXT-Interleave, which simultaneously tackles Multi-image, Multi-frame\n(video), Multi-view (3D), and Multi-patch (single-image) scenarios in LMMs. To\nenable these capabilities, we regard the interleaved data format as a general\ntemplate and compile the M4-Instruct dataset with 1,177.6k samples, spanning 4\nprimary domains with 14 tasks and 41 datasets. We also curate the\nLLaVA-Interleave Bench to comprehensively evaluate the multi-image performance\nof LMMs. Through extensive experiments, LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave achieves leading\nresults in multi-image, video, and 3D benchmarks, while maintaining the\nperformance of single-image tasks. Besides, our model also exhibits several\nemerging capabilities, e.g., transferring tasks across different settings and\nmodalities. Code is available at https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT",

Beginning with a foundational model VTA-LDM built\non a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision\nencoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a\ncomprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and\nvideo-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits\nstate-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities.

Given a generated\nlow-quality video, our approach can increase its spatial and temporal\nresolution simultaneously with arbitrary up-sampling space and time scales\nthrough a unified video diffusion model. Furthermore, VEnhancer effectively\nremoves generated spatial artifacts and temporal flickering of generated\nvideos. To achieve this, basing on a pretrained video diffusion model, we train\na video ControlNet and inject it to the diffusion model as a condition on low\nframe-rate and low-resolution videos. To effectively train this video\nControlNet, we design space-time data augmentation as well as video-aware\nconditioning. Benefiting from the above designs, VEnhancer yields to be stable\nduring training and shares an elegant end-to-end training manner. Extensive\nexperiments show that VEnhancer surpasses existing state-of-the-art video\nsuper-resolution and space-time super-resolution methods in enhancing\nAI-generated videos.

      "abstract": "Customizing text-to-image (T2I) models has seen tremendous progress recently,\nparticularly in areas such as personalization, stylization, and conditional\ngeneration. However, expanding this progress to video generation is still in\nits infancy, primarily due to the lack of customized video data. In this work,\nwe introduce Still-Moving, a novel generic framework for customizing a\ntext-to-video (T2V) model, without requiring any customized video data. The\nframework applies to the prominent T2V design where the video model is built\nover a text-to-image (T2I) model (e.g., via inflation). We assume access to a\ncustomized version of the T2I model, trained only on still image data (e.g.,\nusing DreamBooth or StyleDrop). Naively plugging in the weights of the\ncustomized T2I model into the T2V model often leads to significant artifacts or\ninsufficient adherence to the customization data. To overcome this issue, we\ntrain lightweight Spatial Adapters that adjust the features produced\nby the injected T2I layers. Importantly, our adapters are trained on\n\"frozen videos\" (i.e., repeated images), constructed from image\nsamples generated by the customized T2I model. This training is facilitated by\na novel Motion Adapter module, which allows us to train on such\nstatic videos while preserving the motion prior of the video model. At test\ntime, we remove the Motion Adapter modules and leave in only the trained\nSpatial Adapters. This restores the motion prior of the T2V model while\nadhering to the spatial prior of the customized T2I model. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach on diverse tasks including personalized,\nstylized, and conditional generation. In all evaluated scenarios, our method\nseamlessly integrates the spatial prior of the customized T2I model with a\nmotion prior supplied by the T2V model.",

We propose language-gesture conditioning to generate\nvideos, which is both simpler and clearer than existing language-only methods,\nespecially in complex and uncertain environments.

      "abstract": "Training a classifier on web-crawled data demands learning algorithms that\nare robust to annotation errors and irrelevant examples. This paper builds upon\nthe recent empirical observation that applying unsupervised contrastive\nlearning to noisy, web-crawled datasets yields a feature representation under\nwhich the in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are\nlinearly separable. We show that direct estimation of the separating hyperplane\ncan indeed offer an accurate detection of OOD samples, and yet, surprisingly,\nthis detection does not translate into gains in classification accuracy.\nDigging deeper into this phenomenon, we discover that the near-perfect\ndetection misses a type of clean examples that are valuable for supervised\nlearning. These examples often represent visually simple images, which are\nrelatively easy to identify as clean examples using standard loss- or\ndistance-based methods despite being poorly separated from the OOD distribution\nusing unsupervised learning. Because we further observe a low correlation with\nSOTA metrics, this urges us to propose a hybrid solution that alternates\nbetween noise detection using linear separation and a state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nsmall-loss approach.

This new task requires an intricate integration of control and\ngeneration to realistically synthesize crowd dynamics under specific spatial\nand semantic constraints, whose challenges are yet to be fully explored. On the\none hand, existing human motion generation models typically focus on individual\nbehaviors, neglecting the complexities of collective behaviors. On the other\nhand, recent methods for multi-person motion generation depend heavily on\npre-defined scenarios and are limited to a fixed, small number of inter-person\ninteractions, thus hampering their practicality. To overcome these challenges,\nwe introduce CrowdMoGen, a zero-shot text-driven framework that harnesses the\npower of Large Language Model (LLM) to incorporate the collective intelligence\ninto the motion generation framework as guidance, thereby enabling\ngeneralizable planning and generation of crowd motions without paired training\ndata. Our framework consists of two key components: 1) Crowd Scene Planner that\nlearns to coordinate motions and dynamics according to specific scene contexts\nor introduced perturbations, and 2) Collective Motion Generator that\nefficiently synthesizes the required collective motions based on the holistic\nplans. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have validated the\neffectiveness of our framework, which not only fills a critical gap by\nproviding scalable and generalizable solutions for Crowd Motion Generation task\nbut also achieves high levels of realism and flexibility.",
