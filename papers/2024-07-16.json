We release a comprehensive suite\nof foundational and instruction-tuned language models, encompassing a parameter\nrange from 0.5 to 72 billion, featuring dense models and a Mixture-of-Experts\nmodel. Qwen2 surpasses most prior open-weight models, including its predecessor\nQwen1.5, and exhibits competitive performance relative to proprietary models\nacross diverse benchmarks on language understanding, generation, multilingual\nproficiency, coding, mathematics, and reasoning.\n  The flagship model, Qwen2-72B, showcases remarkable performance: 84.2 on\nMMLU, 37.9 on GPQA, 64.6 on HumanEval, 89.5 on GSM8K, and 82.4 on BBH as a base\nlanguage model. The instruction-tuned variant, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, attains 9.1\non MT-Bench, 48.1 on Arena-Hard, and 35.7 on LiveCodeBench. Moreover, Qwen2\ndemonstrates robust multilingual capabilities, proficient in approximately 30\nlanguages, spanning English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Russian,\nKorean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, and more, underscoring its versatility and\nglobal reach.\n  To foster community innovation and accessibility, we have made the Qwen2\nmodel weights openly available on Hugging Face1 and ModelScope2, and the\nsupplementary materials including example code on GitHub3. These platforms also\ninclude resources for quantization, fine-tuning, and deployment, facilitating a\nwide range of applications and research endeavors.",

To\nmake progress towards better LLM autoraters, we introduce FLAMe, a family of\nFoundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on our large and diverse\ncollection of 100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments,\ncurated and standardized using publicly released human evaluations from\nprevious research. FLAMe significantly improves generalization to a wide\nvariety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like\nGPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. We show that FLAMe can also serve as a\npowerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, using reward\nmodeling evaluation as a case study (FLAMe-RM). Notably, on RewardBench, our\nFLAMe-RM-24B model (with an accuracy of 87.8%) is the top-performing generative\nmodel trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, outperforming both\nGPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we explore a more\ncomputationally efficient approach using a novel tail-patch fine-tuning\nstrategy to optimize our FLAMe multitask mixture for reward modeling evaluation\n(FLAMe-Opt-RM), offering competitive RewardBench performance while requiring\napproximately 25x less training datapoints. Overall, our FLAMe variants\noutperform all popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models we consider across 8\nout of 12 autorater evaluation benchmarks, encompassing 53 quality assessment\ntasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, our analysis reveals\nthat FLAMe is significantly less biased than these LLM-as-a-Judge models on the\nCoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark, while effectively identifying high-quality\nresponses for code generation.",

We demonstrate the efficacy of DataDream through extensive\nexperiments, surpassing state-of-the-art classification accuracy with few-shot\ndata across 7 out of 10 datasets, while being competitive on the other 3.\nAdditionally, we provide insights into the impact of various factors, such as\nthe number of real-shot and generated images as well as the fine-tuning compute\non model performance.

As\nvision language models (VLMs) advance in multimodal understanding and code\ngeneration, VLM-based agents could potentially automate these workflows by\ngenerating SQL queries, Python code, and GUI operations. This automation can\nimprove the productivity of experts while democratizing access to large-scale\ndata analysis. In this paper, we introduce Spider2-V, the first multimodal\nagent benchmark focusing on professional data science and engineering\nworkflows, featuring 494 real-world tasks in authentic computer environments\nand incorporating 20 enterprise-level professional applications. These tasks,\nderived from real-world use cases, evaluate the ability of a multimodal agent\nto perform data-related tasks by writing code and managing the GUI in\nenterprise data software systems. To balance realistic simulation with\nevaluation simplicity, we devote significant effort to developing automatic\nconfigurations for task setup and carefully crafting evaluation metrics for\neach task. Furthermore, we supplement multimodal agents with comprehensive\ndocuments of these enterprise data software systems. Our empirical evaluation\nreveals that existing state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents do not reliably\nautomate full data workflows (14.0% success).

      "abstract": "Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has emerged as a flourishing\nresearch field for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks,\ngreatly reducing trainable parameters while grappling with memory challenges\nduring fine-tuning. To address it, memory-efficient series (METL) avoid\nbackpropagating gradients through the large backbone. However, they compromise\nby exclusively relying on frozen intermediate outputs and limiting the\nexhaustive exploration of prior knowledge from pre-trained models. Moreover,\nthe dependency and redundancy between cross-layer features are frequently\noverlooked, thereby submerging more discriminative representations and causing\nan inherent performance gap (vs. conventional PETL methods). Hence, we propose\nan innovative METL strategy called SHERL for resource-limited scenarios to\ndecouple the entire adaptation into two successive and complementary processes.\nIn the early route, intermediate outputs are consolidated via an\nanti-redundancy operation, enhancing their compatibility for subsequent\ninteractions; thereby in the late route, utilizing minimal late pre-trained\nlayers could alleviate the peak demand on memory overhead and regulate these\nfairly flexible features into more adaptive and powerful representations for\nnew domains. Extensive ablations on vision-and-language and language-only tasks\nshow that SHERL combines the strengths of both parameter and memory-efficient\ntechniques, performing on-par or better across diverse architectures with lower\nmemory during fine-tuning.
